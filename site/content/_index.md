    You need to find the fins you enjoy surfing, and I may be able to help you
    with that. I've learned to design surfing fins using airplane wing template
    foils and mechanical drawing in order to create exacting forms on the
    computer. Thanks to 3D printing and CNC fabrication technology, I can
    translate these works into real form for you. Or, you can do it yourself!

  heading: What I offer

    Third Surf is the name I've chosen to represent what I help make happen.
    What level are you on, when you're amping for your third surf in a day?
    Conversely how amped are you when you get to have your third surf in a week,
    a month or a year?

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
