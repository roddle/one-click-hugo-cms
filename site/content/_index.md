    Our boards are akin to fins themselves.  planing through that water as well

    You need to find the fins you enjoy surfing, and I may be able to help you
    with that. I've learned to design surfing fins using airplane wing template
    foils and mechanical drawing in order to create exacting forms on the
    computer. Thanks to 3D printing and CNC fabrication technology, I can
    translate these works into real form for you. Or, you can do it yourself!

    third surf in a week, a month or a year?

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
